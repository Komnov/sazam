Configure advanced shipping options for your WooCommerce store with custom shipping methods. Be it weight based shipping or volume based shipping or quantity based shipping. You can also add custom fees based on certain conditions. Show or hide shipping methods based on Product Categories or Product Tags.

== Description ==

**[Custom Shipping Methods for WooCommerce](https://wpfactory.com/item/custom-shipping-methods-for-woocommerce/)** plugin lets you add (multiple) custom shipping methods to WooCommerce.

= Shortcodes for cost calculation =

In each custom shipping method's **cost calculation formula** you can use these shortcodes:

* **`[qty]`** - number of items (i.e. **quantity**) in cart,
* **`[cost]`** - total **cost** of items in cart,
* **`[weight]`** - total cart items **weight**,
* **`[volume]`** - total cart items **volume**,
* **`[fee]`** - percentage based **fees**,
* **`[round]`** - **rounding**.

= Rules for each shipping method =

In addition, for each custom shipping method, you can optionally set these **method availability** options:

* min and max cart **cost**,
* min and max cart **weight**,
* min and max cart **volume**,
* min and max cart **quantity**,
* required and excluded cart **products**,
* required and excluded cart **product categories**,
* required and excluded cart **product tags**.

= Costs based on Product Shipping Class =

Optionally costs can be added based on the **product shipping class**:

* costs per **product shipping class** and for **no shipping class**,
* **calculation type**: charge shipping per class or per order,
* **limits calculation**: check limits per class, per order or all.

Advanced options include **custom return URL** - it can be used instead of the standard "Order received" page.

In addition to the above, you can also create customized templates for icons that would be displayed besides the shipping method title.
Also, add custom text with HTML for Free Shipping i.e Zero cost.

= Premium Version =

[Custom Shipping Methods for WooCommerce Pro](https://wpfactory.com/item/custom-shipping-methods-for-woocommerce/) plugin version also has:

* **`[costs_table]`** shortcode for **table rate shipping** - Costs are calculated using Google Distance Matrix API,
* **`[distance]`** shortcode for **distance based cost calculation**,
* options to set **free shipping minimum order amount**,
* options to set **free shipping products**,
* options to set **min and max cost limits**,
